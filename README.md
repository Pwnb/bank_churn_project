# Bank Churn Project
 A ML project using logistics regression, KNN, random forest to prediction the churn rate of a bank.



## Overview

This is a **whole project** using 3 models (Logistics Regression, KNN, and Random Forest) to predict customer volume. In the project, it trains 3 models first and picks the best one after the evalution as the final prediction model. The whole pipeline contains **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, **searching better parameters**, and **model evaluation**.
